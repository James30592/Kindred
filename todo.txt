To do:

-	validation on data that can be sent to server, including from the url itself (eg. atm server crashes if changing questions category in url to an invalid one).




Optional to do:

-	make so can filter questions for each category when retrieving new questions.
Films		TMDB			Age rating	Release date	With people (crew / actor)	Genre(s)		
TV		TMDB			Air date		Genre(s)		
Music		Spotify			Genre (if I make a playlist for each genre)		
Books		OpenLibrary		Not possible		
Video Games	RAWG			Platform	Developer	Publisher	Genre(s)	Tag(s)	Release date






do different categories of question:

personality, films, TV, books, music (artists), video games, hobbies, sports (watch and play?), places to visit on holiday? food? sense of humour

do recommendation algorithm stuff

user top10 lists for all interests (films, books etc.), option to mark a film as a top10 when rating it and then if this list gets full it asks you which one you want to replace for it

do different types of question and data for answers - ie. not just multiple choice? - think about how to do similarity for answers that aren't on a simple scale

do map of results for find kindred

research psychology for doing the personality questions

import feature for importing likes on films, tv, books etc.

make it so can answer some questions and make a profile without yet creating an account, then prompt to create an account to save progress


Personality		General
			Scenarios
			Logic
			Sense of humour
			etcâ€¦
Interests		Films
			TV
			Books
			Music (artists)
			Video games
			Hobbies
			Sports (watch / play)


on your profile, list favourites in each of the interests categories, life advice, opinions on current issues?

perhaps have different colour to represent each category, and when filtering by category / categories the colour scheme of the map / links changes to match that of the selected categories.

perhaps see a map view of all the other strongest links between other people in the world, get a sense of which countries have stuff in common, or how much most people have in common, if you're more individual or not... this could be good for sharing, people sharing chart that shows they are outside the bell curve for how they think / their tastes

use local storage to store user's kindred lists and recommendations

find a way for me to pinch real people's tastes in films etc to populate fake profiles

use validation on any user submitted data to make sure it can't mess up anything on the server







Recommendations:

recommendations is working now, think about making it on the same page as findKindred in the end, since it's just an extension of that and is doing a similar find kindred thing first (although slightly different variant of findKindred)

Other options for the recommendation algorithm:
- change the threshold value. actually better to do a more complex way of getting the kindred list, like only using very similar users if possible, otherwise widening it a little maybe.
- make it so its not a linear effect of compUser similarity difference on the weighted sim rating, maybe make it a different function
- limit recommendations so they require x number of users to have answered this question for it to be a recommendation (eg. so if one very similar user rates an obscure film very highly but noone else has rated it, it could prevent this film from being shown so high up the recommend list).
- in the getRecommendations() code, factor in not just the simScore of each compUser for the weighting of each question answer, but also the number of answers this user had in common. also for kindredList, maybe rather than first comparing on simScore and then on numCommonAnswers, it should be a formula that multiplies the two somehow.
- currently am doing a positive / negative adjustment for each recommend item score based on whether the compUser rated things generally higher or lower than the main user. uses percDiff in the UserSimComp.

To do:

-	way to edit past answers
-	user needs to be able to search

-	front end side, different look and details for each category

	TV (TMDB)
	Books (openlibrary) https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/ID/8578467-M.jpg
	Music (spotify)
	Video games (RAWG)


Done:

-	when getting more Qs for queue from API source, it will remember the max page for the current filters and only fetch from API from this page for efficiency. as soon as filters are changed though, a new queue is generated which will start from page 1 to build the queue.
just need to make it so when filters are changed in front end code that isNewQueue is set to true when calling update()...

-	at the moment, questions page is set up to query DB every time a user's questions queue needs adding to. db will be queried and questions in this category will be checked. alternative could be to use another repository object to store all DB questions here if I know there won't be that many, would save many queries to the database.

-	made it so answers are submitted every 10 mins or on leaving the questions page (async using sendBeacon). More efficient, fewer interactions with server / db than doing it every answer.
